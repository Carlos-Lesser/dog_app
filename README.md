# Introduction
The World Canine Organization currently recognizes 339 breeds of dogs. One might think that identifying dog breeds is a simple task, but some breeds look so similar that can become difficult for humans to classify.For Example, in the Image below we can observe two different breeds that look almost the same. 

![alt text](https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F47%2F2021%2F06%2F15%2FBoston-Terrier-vs-French-Bulldog-02-2-2000.jpg)

The image on the left is a Boston Terrier and the Image on the right is a French Bulldog. As you can observe it is not that easy for humans to classify all dog breeds correctly. What about a computer, can a computer classify dog breeds better than a human? In this project I build a dog image classification model using InceptionV3 with 88% accuracy and I was able to deploy the model online using Streamlit.

 ### :cactus: Branches

 I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. **`stage`** is the development branch.

2. **`master`** is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.

**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with `feat` and followed by feature name. (ie. `feat-FEATURE-NAME`)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `stage` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.
